    "## What does the algorithm do?\n",
    "The following algorithm outputs permutations of the characters given as input as a list. A permutation is defined as *each of the several possible ways in which a set or number of things can be ordered or arranged*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it do it?\n",
    "The general idea behind recursively creating a permutation of a sequence of characters is that we go through all characters in the sequence, **freeze** a portion of the sequence and permute the remaining characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### f1\n",
    "In the first function `f1`, we receive as input:\n",
    "* `sequence`: a sequence of characters. \n",
    "* `end`: an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function prints all characters in the sequence on separate lines, followed by a final new line at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### f2\n",
    "In the second function `f2`, we the input is:\n",
    "* `sequence`: a sequence of characters.\n",
    "* `start`: an integer that specifies the start index of the sequence of characters.\n",
    "* `end`: an integer that specifies the end index of the sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two values `start` and `end` are equal, it means that we have reached the end of a single permutation, and the function `f1` described above is called to print the permuted sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of `start` is different from the value of `end`, we loop over all indeces from `start` to `end`. During each iteration of the loop, we first swap the starting value of the sequence with the `ith` character in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. when `start = 0` and `i = 1`, we get `abc` -> `bac`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this because we want to **freeze** a start character in place while permuting the remaining characters in the sequence. Permuting the subsequence is the same as permuting the entire sequence, so we make a recursive call to `f2` with the start value increased by `1`, which will make the for loop operate over a smaller subsequence of the original sequence. We will hit the bottom of the recursion tree when the subsequence is of length 1, at which point `f1` is called and a single character is printed. Once we have exited a recursive call, we again swap the start with the `ith` character in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion tree below shows the swapping and freezing of characters in the sequence.\n",
